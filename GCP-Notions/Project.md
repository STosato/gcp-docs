# Project
Is a critical, **billable unit** with credit associated.
It is not a resource, just a **logical grouping**

Every [[Resource]] belongs to a **project**.
May be organized in **folders**.
Organization is an entity **at the top** of the hierarchy. (Only visible if using *GSuite*, otherwise is not visible)
