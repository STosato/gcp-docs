# Serverless Computing
is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates **machine resources on demand**, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers.

No need to provision or configure resources beforehand.

"Serverless" is a misnomer: servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers.
